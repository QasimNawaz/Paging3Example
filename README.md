# Development Roadmap

[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - LiveData is an observable data holder class

[Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) - Works very well with coroutines, provides us with cold streams which can be transformed using well known reactive operators.

[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way

[Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines) - For offloading long running tasks to background

[Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - For storing our application data

[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - For making API calls

[Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - For dependency injection

[Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) - Gradleâ€™s Kotlin DSL provides an alternative syntax to the traditional Groovy DSL with an enhanced editing experience in supported IDEs, with superior content assist, refactoring, documentation, and more

[Databinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - To bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically

[Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network
