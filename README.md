# Paging3Example
The Paging Library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over the network. This approach allows your app to use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently. This app is created as a sample app which loads list of images using jetpack paging library + Groupie and the second example is using paging library with RemoteMediator + Room Database.

This project is under development.
